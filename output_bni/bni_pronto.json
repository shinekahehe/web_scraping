    "my_favourite_bni_story": "From Shyness to Confidence Once upon a time, there was a boy named Amarpall. He was shy and silent, often lost in the background, his big dreams and desires flickering like distant stars. Despite his growing career, he struggled to find visibility and opportunities, feeling stuck in his comfort zone. Each day blended into the next, and his potential remained largely untapped. Then one day, everything changed. Amarpall discovered BNI (Business Network International). With a mix of excitement and apprehension, he took the plunge, hoping to find a way to connect with others and share his ambitions. At first, it was daunting. Standing in a room full of vibrant personalities, he felt the familiar grip of shyness. But as the weeks passed, he began to see the transformation unfold. BNI provided him not just a platform to network but also the tools to unlock the hidden skills within himself. He learned the art of communication and the importance of building relationships. Slowly but surely, Amarpall stepped out of his comfort zone, engaging with fellow members and sharing his journey. With every meeting, he gained confidence, and the once-intimidating thought of speaking on stage turned into an exhilarating challenge he eagerly embraced. The boy who had once struggled to express himself became a dynamic networker, connecting with people from all walks of life. Each conversation ignited his passion, and he found joy in exchanging ideas, fostering relationships, and creating opportunities not just for himself but for others as well. Today, Amarpall stands tall, no longer the shy boy in the corner but a confident individual ready to take on the world. His journey with BNI has transformed him into the perfect networker, proving that stepping out of one's comfort zone can lead to incredible growth and fulfillment. And so, he continues to chase his dreams, now with the skills and confidence to turn them into reality, knowing that every connection is a step closer to success",

    "top_problem_solved": "Recent Design Solution: A recent client approached us with a unique requirement: they wanted to build two 2BHK apartments on the first floor and a spacious duplex covering the second and third floors. The challenge was to create a design that balanced functionality and aesthetics while ensuring privacy and comfort for each living space. Solution: We began by carefully analyzing the available space and the client's specific needs. For the first floor, we designed two 2BHK units with efficient layouts that maximized space utilization. Each apartment features an open-plan living and dining area, well-ventilated bedrooms, and modern kitchens, ensuring comfort and convenience for future occupants. The second and third floors were dedicated to the duplex. We created a seamless flow between the two levels by incorporating a stylish internal staircase that became a central design feature. The lower level of the duplex includes an expansive living area, a guest bedroom, and a large kitchen, all designed to create a sense of openness. The upper level houses the master suite and additional bedrooms, offering privacy and luxury. Throughout the design process, we paid close attention to natural light, ventilation, and material selection, ensuring that each space is not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing. The end result was a cohesive design that met the client’s expectations and provided a comfortable, elegant living environment. The client was thrilled with the outcome, particularly appreciating the thoughtful layout and attention to detail that made each living space unique yet harmonious with the overall design.",

    "my_favourite_bni_story": "*\"My favourite BNI story is actually about my own beginning here. The philosophy of this organization is built upon the idea of Givers Gain®: by giving business to others, you will get business in return. This is predicated on the age‑old principle that what goes around, comes around. As a new member, I connect strongly with these values. For me, professionalism means building credibility and relationships, and coaching others to grow. Even in my short time here, I’ve already seen how introductions and trust create opportunities. That is why I believe BNI is not just networking — it is a platform where values like giving, trust, and relationship‑building transform into long‑term success.\"*",
