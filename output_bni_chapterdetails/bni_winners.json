    "my_business": "Gift of the Present specializes in ‘Strategic Corporate Gifting’ which involves crafting and curating gifts to businesses for their prospects, clients, employees, or business partners with specific goals in mind. We ensure a cohesive and branded gifting experience. We believe that corporate gifting should go beyond generic items and embrace the uniqueness of each occasion.",
    "top_product": "Unique Gift sets Custom-made mementos Category based gifts Themed gifts Kerala based cultural gifts VIP Gifts",
    "ideal_referral": "An ideal referral would be to get connected with an organization looking to do corporate gifts with a difference or looking to make an impact as strategic gifting is my forte. Gift Of The Present curates gifting experiences and solutions that create a 'Wow' factor either by: 1. Connecting the gift with the brand 2. Bringing an emotional touch 3. Sourcing of functional/useful gifts 4. Making the gift look most appealing I am hoping to get connected with companies that are more focused on quality and creativity rather than price. Having said that, we always work around the budget stipulated by the client.",
    "top_problem_solved": "1. Curating gifts that 'Stand Out' 2. Quality is a given! 3. Time Management - In most cases, timing is what is most challenging; clients often come with last-minute requirements such as gifts to give away at their annual meetings to attendees and delegates. Although I prefer to plan in advance and do everything systematically, practically speaking, requirements come in at the 11th hour, which I have been able to accommodate and turn around without any compromise in the quality delivered.",
    "my_favourite_bni_story": "I was driving to my BNI offline meeting and saw ads of Shah Rukh Khan as the new brand ambassador of Muthoot Pappachan Group ( Blue Muthoot) on the Metro pillars of Kochi Metro; and I hoped that I could do a gift for him as I have been gifting to all the brand ambassadors of The Muthoot Group (Red Muthoot) i.e. Sri. Amitabh Bachchan, MS Dhoni, Madhuri Dixit etc for the last few years. I decided to make this my specific ask at that meeting and asked to be connected to a top level executive at Muthoot Pappachan Group. Within a few days, my chapter member connected me to the Director of the Group and within a month I handed over some beautifully curated Onam gifts for not only Shah Rukh Khan but also for Vidya Balan and I am currently taking care of all the gifting requirements for the group. This is truly the power and magic of BNI and the law of attraction!",
