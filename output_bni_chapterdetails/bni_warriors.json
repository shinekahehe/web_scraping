Many business owners struggle with low visibility, poor engagement, and a lack of quality leads even after promotions. I help them convert attention into enquiries through strategic digital marketing, powerful content, and high-impact video promotions. Simply put, if you know a business that wants more leads, stronger brand presence, and measurable ROI from digital platforms, I’m the right connect.",
    "my_favourite_bni_story": "My favourite BNI story is when we set up an Onam stall and achieved maximum visibility and great business results. With the support of BNI members, the stall attracted strong footfall, meaningful conversations, and quality business enquiries. It clearly showed how the right visibility at the right place can directly convert into real business opportunities",
