    "my_favourite_bni_story": "n the world of business networking, every handshake, every introduction, and every small act of service has the potential to open doors we never anticipated. This story is a testament to the power of relationships built through BNI and how a simple opportunity turned into a prestigious event collaboration. On December 11, 2022, I was given the responsibility to pick up and escort the Chief Guest for the BNI GIVERS RUN event—Mr. Rajnish Henry, the esteemed Chief of the Indian Blind Cricket Team. Though my role was not to manage the event, I took the opportunity to engage, connect, and build rapport with him during our time together. Rather than treating it as just another task, I saw it as a moment to create a lasting impression—to listen, share insights, and nurture a professional relationship. That simple interaction, a conversation during the ride, and a genuine connection planted the seed for something much bigger. Fast forward to 2025, my phone rang, and on the other end was none other than Mr. Rajnish Henry. He remembered the trust and professionalism I had shown during that brief encounter in 2022. This time, he wasn’t just calling for a pickup—he was calling me to organize the grand inauguration of the IndusInd Bank Women’s National T20 Cricket Tournament for the Blind – 5th Edition at Durbar Hall Ground, Kochi. The opportunity to be part of such a national-level sporting event was an honor. What started as a small connection through the BNI platform had now transformed into a high-profile event collaboration—one that wouldn’t have happened without BNI’s emphasis on building meaningful relationships and trust over time. The Lesson? BNI is not just about business referrals—it’s about being present, making an impact, and cultivating long-term relationships. You never know when a simple meeting can turn into a career-defining opportunity. BNI doesn’t just create connections; it creates success stories!",
