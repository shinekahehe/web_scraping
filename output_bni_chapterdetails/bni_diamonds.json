However, the unique rules of indoor cricket posed challenges for players and organizers alike. My chapter member, Mr. Riza Ahmed, who owns an indoor cricket stadium, was at the forefront of this growing trend. He quickly realized that while the game was thrilling, managing the matches and keeping track of scores was a complex task. Riza was determined to streamline his operations and enhance the experience for his players. That's when I stepped in. With his vision and my expertise in mobile application development, we embarked on a journey to make indoor cricket more accessible and enjoyable. I developed a custom mobile application tailored to the specific needs of indoor cricket. The app not only simplified the management of the games but also ensured that the unique rules were seamlessly integrated into the system. From automatic score calculations to real-time updates and player statistics, the app covered every aspect of the game. The impact was immediate. Riza found that managing games became a breeze, and players were more engaged than ever. The app also introduced a booking system that allowed teams to reserve slots at the stadium, reducing downtime and maximising usage. Word spread quickly, and more players and teams began flocking to Riza's stadium, boosting his business.",

The organization faces key challenges in securing critical operational information, maintaining compliance, and reducing the risks of information security breaches A leading media and entertainment company in India recently faced a sharp rise in cyber threats, including a ransomware attack on one of its critical applications. With sensitive personal data at stake, the organization initiated a comprehensive Security Control Assessment (SCA) to evaluate its current security measures and pinpoint areas for improvement. A leading US healthcare provider, concerned about the rising number of ransomware attacks and the need to protect sensitive patient data, realized its internal cybersecurity team lacked the capacity for 24/7 monitoring. Despite having tools and dedicated staff, coverage gaps remained. By adopting a Managed Detection and Prevention service, the client reduced the cost of maintaining a full in-house team while ensuring continuous real-time monitoring and rapid threat response. Amid disruptions in the traditional healthcare business model, a leading US provider sought to identify security gaps in its critical applications that were impacting time-to-market and aimed to embed security into the development process. The challenge was heightened by a complex, heterogeneous technology stack involving multiple third-party vendors and partners.",

    "my_favourite_bni_story": "One of my favorite BNI stories comes from a referral I received through a fellow member. A client had been looking for a unique destination for their company’s annual retreat, and after a brief conversation with the BNI member, I was introduced to the company. Not only did I curate a tailor-made retreat that exceeded their expectations, but the success of that event led to an ongoing partnership, bringing in multiple referrals for future corporate travel. What made it special was not just the business success, but the trust and camaraderie I experienced through BNI. It showed me the power of building strong relationships within the chapter, where every referral feels like a step toward mutual success.",
