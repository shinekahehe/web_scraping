Despite the challenging situation, I had a group of clients who were eager to experience the beauty of Kashmir. Understanding the gravity of the situation, I worked tirelessly, staying in constant touch with local contacts, authorities, and hotels to ensure safety without compromising the experience. While the environment was tense, I coordinated every detail — from flight adjustments to alternate routes, and even providing real-time updates to my clients. It was a stressful few days, but seeing the gratitude in their eyes as they safely enjoyed the breathtaking landscapes of Kashmir was incredibly rewarding. This experience truly reinforced my commitment to going the extra mile, no matter the circumstance, to ensure my clients' safety and satisfaction.",

The company needed a robust strategy to boost visibility and generate quality leads interested in premium home theater installations. Solution: Mekanize Digital developed a tailored digital marketing strategy to address the company's needs. We focused on: 1. Website Optimization – We enhanced the website for SEO, ensuring it was fast, mobile-friendly, and included high-conversion landing pages showcasing their premium products and services. 2. Social Media Campaigns – We created visually compelling content, including project showcases, testimonials, and behind-the-scenes videos of installations. Targeted ads were run to reach potential customers in the desired geographic area. 3. Lead Magnets – We introduced valuable offers, such as a free consultation or a home theater design guide, to incentivize visitors to provide their contact details. 4. Email Marketing & Automation – We set up an automated email sequence that nurtured leads with informative content about home theater systems and exclusive promotional offers. 5. Google Ads & Local SEO – We implemented targeted Google Ads campaigns and optimized local SEO, ensuring the company appeared prominently in local searches related to home theater installations. Outcome: Within three months, the company saw a significant increase in website traffic, with over 40% more visitors coming through search engines and social media. Lead generation increased by 50%, with a notable rise in consultations and inquiries. The company’s sales team received more high-quality leads who were eager to move forward with premium",

Thanks to BNI, we were able to connect, and I was thrilled to provide her with a custom kasavu saree that made her wedding day even more unforgettable.

Outcome: The wedding went on as planned, even with the change of venue. The couple was relieved and thrilled that the event unfolded beautifully, with everything taken care of seamlessly.

Ltd. operates across major cities including Kerala, Bangalore, Chennai, Coimbatore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Pune, Kolhapur, Surat, and Ahmedabad.",
    "top_product": "Our core products are EV chargers, available in both slow and fast charging categories. In India, slow chargers refer to AC chargers, and fast chargers refer to DC chargers.

In addition to chargers, we supply all EV charger-related components such as cables, switchgear, and accessories.

These products together support complete charging infrastructure development for homes, commercial spaces, fleets, and public networks.",

NRIs looking to invest in one of India’s fastest-growing industries and landowners with properties near highways, restaurants, shopping complexes, or any location where customer vehicles can be parked and charged are also perfect referrals for me. Anyone planning to set up an EV charging station as a new revenue model or value-added service would be an excellent connection.",
    "top_problem_solved": "When major EV OEMs such as MG, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, BMW, Hyundai, Kia, Mini, Tesla and Ather entered the Indian market, one of their biggest challenges was finding a reliable, pan-India partner for EV charger installation and maintenance. At that time, we had just begun our journey in Kochi, and our customers asked us to build a nationwide network. Despite the difficulties of expanding from a single location to multiple states, we confidently accepted the challenge. Through our technical expertise, strong framework, and professional execution, we successfully delivered on our promise. Today, we operate in 8 states with 50+ employees, serving major metro cities such as Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and Ahmedabad. Our customers are happy, and we continue to grow as a trusted pan-Indian partner in the EV charging industry.",
    "my_favourite_bni_story": "I joined BNI five years ago—right after the world experienced one of its toughest challenges, the COVID pandemic. That decision became one of the most transformational moments in my career. BNI helped sharpen my leadership, communication, people management, and overall business skills. It has shaped me into a stronger and more confident business person. But my favorite BNI story comes from something I learned through BNI University. I listened to a podcast by Dr. Ivan Misner that truly changed my approach. He said that a 30-second presentation should not be a sales pitch. In today’s world, people don’t connect with sales pitches; they connect with vision and passion. He suggested that instead of selling, we should share how we help the industry, how we solve pain points, and what our larger vision is. When someone feels inspired by your purpose, they don’t remain just a referral partner—they can become your promoter or even your investor. I took this lesson seriously and applied it consistently. I focused on building credibility, nurturing relationships, and inspiring others with my vision and actions. And the result? Three years ago, I received a major breakthrough—I found an investor through BNI. That experience made the lesson even more meaningful and confirmed that inspiration and authenticity always win. This is my favorite story in BNI, and it continues to guide the way I grow myself and my business.",
